                <strong id="business-casual">1.	Do I have to dress business casual for Virtual Expo?</strong><br>
                <p>Yes. Employers can initiate a private video chat, so you should be prepared to be on camera.</p>
		<strong id="resume">2.	How do I give my resume to an employer?</strong><br>
                <p>When registering through the ECAC System and making your profile, you will be able to upload files, including a resume. Once you enter an employer<span>&#39;</span>s room, recruiters will be able to view your profile and thus your resume.</p>
		<strong id="talk-recruiter">3.	How long will I have to talk to a recruiter?</strong><br>
                <p>It will depend on the recruiter. Just like in in-person career fairs, be prepared with questions about that employer as well as answers to questions that the recruiter may ask you, based on your initial introduction as well as any positions for which you are interested.</p>
		<strong id="students-converstion">4.	Will other students be listening to my conversation with the recruiter?</strong><br>
                <p>Any messages you send in the main chat room will be seen by other students. However, in a private chat, the messages will be seen only by you and the recruiter.</p>
		<strong id="wait-time">5.	How long is the wait time to talk to a recruiter?</strong><br>
                <p>There is no queue to talk to the recruiters and thus no wait time. When you enter an employer<span>&#39;</span>s room, you are automatically put in the main chat where you can message the recruiters at any time. Keep in mind that any messages sent in the main chat will be seen by all students and recruiters in the room. In terms of a private chat, there is no queue for this either. It is up to you or the recruiter to initiate a private chat. Please note that you will not be able to initiate a private chat if the recruiter<span>&#39;</span>s status is set to <span>&#34;</span>Busy.<span>&#34;</span> However, if it is set to <span>&#34;</span>Available,<span>&#34;</span> we would recommend that you proactively message the recruiters to express interest and request a private chat.</p>
		<strong id="type-of-positions">6.	Will I be able to tell what type of positions and majors an employer is recruiting for?</strong><br>
                <p>Yes. You can view this under the employer<span>&#39;</span>s profile.</p>
		<strong id="internet-connection">7.	What do I do if my internet connection goes out in the middle of a conversation?</strong><br>
                <p>We recommend testing your connection before participating in this virtual event. If you have access to your Wi-Fi router, it is best to connect with an ethernet cable directly. Once reconnected, re-enter the same employer chat room to request another private chat with the same recruiter. Apologize for the technical interruption and proceed with your conversation.</p>
		<strong id="what-to-have">8.	What should I have with me when attending Virtual Expo?</strong><br>
                <p>We would recommend having a notepad and pen/pencil on hand in case there is anything you would like to write down, such as remembering the name of the recruiter/employer representative with whom you chat. Also plan on having your resume readily available, just in case you need to reference it during your conversations with recruiters. Other than that, just bring your professional self and a smile!</p>
		<strong id="practice-software">9.	Will there be time to practice using the software before speaking with recruiters?</strong><br>
                <p>No. The event will not go live until the day of, so you will not be able to practice using the software. However, we recommend browsing the platform where you will be able to see the employers attending and their chat times as well as the positions, degrees, and majors recruited for.</p>
		<strong id="register-both-days">10.	Do I need to register for both days of Expo separately?</strong><br>
                <p>Yes. Day 1 and Day 2 are set up as two separate events in the ECAC System, so if you want to attend both, you must register for both individually. </p>
		<strong id="number-students">11.	Is there a limit to the number of students in one employer chat room?</strong><br>
                <p>Yes. There can be no more than 92 students in a chat room concurrently. If a room is full, you may want to go visit another employer<span>&#39;</span>s chat room and then return to that first one.</p>
		<strong id="private-video-calls">12.	How many simultaneous private video chats can go on per room?</strong><br>
                <p>There is no limit to the number of private video chats per room.</p>
		<strong id="private-chat">13.	Am I guaranteed to have a private chat with a recruiter?</strong><br>
                <p>No. Consequently, it is important for you to be proactive and engaged in the chat rooms. You can do this by asking questions in the main chat and by messaging recruiters if their settings permit it.</p>
		<strong id="start-private-chat">14.	Do I have to start a private chat to start a video chat?</strong><br>
                <p>Yes. You can only have a video chat in a private chat.</p>
		<strong id="send-messages-online">15.	Can you send messages to recruiters when they are not online?</strong><br>
                <p>No. You can only send messages to recruiters when they are online.</p>

                        <p>Though there is no rule forbidding on-the-spot interviews during the career fair, due to students waiting to speak with recruiters, we do not recommend interviewing during the career fair.</p>

                        <p>Because of the booth capacity on the virtual platform, we have a limited number of employers we can allow to participate in Expo each semester. Registration for Expo is on a first-come, first-served basis; employers who register first get precedence, and once the waitlist is started, employers that register after the waitlist has been begun are no longer guaranteed a spot in the fair. However, there are inevitably a number of spots that open up in August, and we will invite employers from the waitlist to fill these spaces at that time. If your organization is on the waitlist, please wait to be contacted by us if any openings become available. Please be patient, and we will let you know if a spot opens up. In August, be prepared to act quickly if you are notified of an opening.</p>

                        <p>The Expo Senior Reception is held on the evening prior to the career fair. Only students with senior standing are invited to the event, and the reception is an opportunity for these students to speak with employers about full-time opportunities with the employer. This year, Senior Reception will be held virtually, but the essence of the event will be maintained as much as possible. In person stuff The senior reception is a catered event, but not a sit-down dinner, so that students are able to speak with different recruiters. We highly encourage recruiters to wear clothing indicative of their organization for maximum visibility.</p>

                        <p>There is no official end date for registration, but the corporate capacity for Expo is limited by the virtual platform. Previously, we have filled up well before the deadline, so we highly encourage signing up as soon as registration begins during the last week of April 2021, as space is filled on a first-come, first-served basis during registration. </p>

                        <p>Credit card payments are the only accepted payment option for Fall Expo. Once registration opens, and the employer is confirmed for the event, a link will be provided to pay with a credit card. Note that the best browser to use for payment by card in this case is Mozilla Firefox.</p>
